Here's a `README.md` file for your Kalman filter project based on the tutorial at [kalmanfilter.net](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx):

# Kalman Filter Tutorial Implementation

This project implements the sections of the [Kalman Filter Tutorial](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx) by B. Welsh. The goal is to provide a structured, clean Python implementation of each concept introduced in the tutorial, with clear code and explanations for educational purposes.

## 📚 Tutorial Sections Implemented

We follow the tutorial's structure, implementing each section in order:

1. **Introduction to Kalman Filters**
2. **The Process to be Estimated**
3. **The Measurement**
4. **The Kalman Filter Equations**
5. **One-Dimensional Kalman Filter Example**
6. **Multidimensional Kalman Filter**
7. **Kalman Filter in Matrix Form**
8. **Example Applications**
   - Constant velocity model
   - Constant acceleration model
   - Noisy measurements

Each section will be implemented in its own Python module or notebook, with detailed comments and visualizations when applicable.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `matplotlib` for visualizations (only where required)
- `numpy` for matrix operations

To install the requirements:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
